Read me for Lab 9:

This lab wasnt too hard to do. I originally took a stab at it like 20 days ago 
but because I had not done lab 8 I was unable to do this one because I was
running into COORs problems trying to read the JSON from my local machine. It 
sucked, but now that I did lab 8 I was easily able to do this one.
