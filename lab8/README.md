This lab was pretty straight forward, and its my bad it is so unbelievably late,
I'm hoping I can still get some partial credit.

I've had a super hectic last few weeks and to top it all off when I first tried
to do this lab I tried to do it on my mac. I probably spent like 2 hours trying 
to figure it out but ended up giving up and then putting it off.
