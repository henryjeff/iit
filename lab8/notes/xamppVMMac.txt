- cd /opt/lampp/phpmyadmin
- chmod 777 config.inc.php

- navigate to the file using the browse option on the file->mount option on the bitnami server panel
- edit using any editor

-back in terminal 
-chmod 744 config.inc.php

NOTE: for reinstall or ‘Do over’ : shut down the vm and then delete the ~/.bitnami folder data
