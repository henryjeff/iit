For this lab it was pretty straight forward. I don't have much too add.
I guess I should mention I added a gitignore file in my site repo so that
this repo wont track my .DS_Store files anymore since I'm on a mac.

I also did the extra credit using the window.onload = () => { ... }
function.

That's all!
